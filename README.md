i will be making use of the following syntax
- loop          used
- funcion       used 
- List          used
# Tought Process
- i made use of an inbuilt function called "random.choice()" to choose at random from the given *List* in other to choose for computer 
- Then I created two functions called *check_player()* and *check_computer()* that checks if the player and computer picks [Rock, Paper, Scissors]
- after which the *game()* function will check and compare what was picked by each player. and print out the winner.
- the *game()* function will keep running if invalid option is inserted or the players picked the same value.
